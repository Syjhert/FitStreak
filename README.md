<h1>**FitStreak**</h1>

FitStreak is an app that tracks user health goals and encourages them to work on these goals. The various ways this project encourages users are trackers for sleep, hydration levels, medicine intake, and exercise reminders or a custom health goal. These goals can be tweaked based on user needs any time they want to.  The app also provides useful information, informative graphs, and insightful comments to guide the user to their health journey.
